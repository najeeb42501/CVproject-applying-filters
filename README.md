Description
This project is a computer vision application developed using Python and the Tkinter library for the GUI. It allows users to upload images and apply various image processing filters such as Gaussian, Butterworth, and Laplacian. Additionally, users can perform histogram matching using a reference image. The application provides a user-friendly interface to visualize the original, processed, and reference images along with displaying basic image statistics.

Features
Upload Image: Allows users to upload an image from their local filesystem.
Apply Gaussian Filter: Applies a Gaussian blur to the uploaded image.
Apply Butterworth Filter: Applies a Butterworth filter to the uploaded image.
Apply Laplacian Filter: Applies a Laplacian filter to the uploaded image.
Upload Reference Image: Allows users to upload a reference image for histogram matching.
Histogram Matching: Matches the histogram of the uploaded image to that of the reference image.
Display Image Statistics: Displays the mean and standard deviation of the uploaded and processed images.
